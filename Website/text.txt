Introduction
For this project we were given the brief of having to ingest, blend and analyse forecasted weather data from the MetOffice and Twitter to compare the accuracy of MetOffice forecasting to a quantified record of live weather retrieved from the Twitter.  We collected data from the 6th December 2016 to 8th January 2017 in the London region and then used plot.ly to produce graphs to see if there were any relationships. 

Files and details used in this project can be found at https://github.com/rachaelecole/WeatherTwitterProject.



The first 2 graphs show the proportions of words in tweets for each weather type. The pie chart shows the percentages of each weather word in the tweets collected. The stacked bar chart demonstrates the same thing but over datetime. From our tweets we can conclude that over the time period, fog and rain were the most tweeted about weather types. 

The third graph shows the weather predictions made by the MetOffice for 'Foggy', 'Cloudy', 'Rain' and 'Sunny' weather types. From this graph it can be seen that it was mostly cloudy but very little rain and fog. The opposing results between Twitter and the MetOffice is most likely to be because Twitter users and the MetOffice have very different interpretations of the weather.
